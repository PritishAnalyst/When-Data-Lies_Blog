    <h1>The Hidden Cost of Dirty Data</h1>
    <p>Why Analytics Projects Fail and How to Fix It</p>
  </header>

  <section class="section">
    <p>You’ve probably heard about the power of analytics and AI—how they can transform decision‑making overnight. But the truth is that behind every successful insight lies clean, consistent, and complete data. When those elements are missing, even the best tools crumble.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section horizontal">
    <div class="column">
      <h2>What Is “Dirty Data”?</h2>
      <p>Dirty data refers to records that are missing, inaccurate, inconsistent, or duplicated. It’s the kind of data that quietly undermines analytics and sows doubt about findings.</p>
      <p>Issues include typos, outdated values, conflicting formats across systems, and repeated entries that skew analysis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Poor decisions:</strong> Wrong data leads to wrong insights, leading to failed strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource waste:</strong> Analysts spend time cleaning instead of analyzing.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust erosion:</strong> Executives and customers lose confidence in data tools.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>A Wake‑Up Example: Google Flu Trends</h2>
    <p>One famous failure involved a flu‑tracking project that used search trends to predict outbreaks. It repeatedly overestimated flu cases, sometimes by more than 100%. Changes in user search habits and algorithm bias led to misleading forecasts—demonstrating how inaccurate data and assumptions can derail even large-scale analytics efforts.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section horizontal">
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Everyday Business Consequences</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Retailers mismanage inventory due to inaccurate sales records.</li>
        <li>Financial firms misjudge risk using outdated customer data.</li>
        <li>Healthcare providers delay care because of fragmented patient records.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Reported Impacts</h2>
      <p>Organizations often report: millions lost annually, reduced productivity, and increasing reputational risk. Industry surveys estimate poor data contributes to 20 – 30 % of operating costs in many companies.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Root Causes of Dirty Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lack of governance:</strong> No common standards across departments.</li>
      <li><strong>Manual entry errors:</strong> Typos, missing values, inconsistent formats.</li>
      <li><strong>Legacy systems and silos:</strong> Isolated systems store conflicting versions of the same data.</li>
      <li><strong>Volume overload:</strong> Too much data without prioritization creates noise instead of insight.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section horizontal">
    <div class="column">
      <h2>Best Practices to Turn Clean Data into Insight</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Define clear data standards and formats.</li>
        <li>Automate cleaning: detect duplicates, missing values, outliers.</li>
        <li>Continuously monitor quality—don’t wait until analysis starts.</li>
        <li>Include humans in the loop to flag bias or anomalies.</li>
        <li>Foster data ownership across all departments—not just IT.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h2>The Value of Doing It Right</h2>
      <p>Reliable data supports accurate insights, higher ROI, faster decisions, and customer trust. Organizations that treat data governance and quality as strategic priorities are the ones whose analytics yield real impact.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Analytics failures often stem not from tools or algorithms, but from the data feeding them. When organizations commit to high data quality, governance, and continuous oversight, they build a foundation for analytics that delivers real value. Otherwise, analytics risks becoming a costly illusion.</p>
